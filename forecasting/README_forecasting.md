# Quantitative Finance with Machine Learning
## Forecasting

This folder contains various methods for forecasting stock prices, though the same techniques can easily be applied to other financial assets or variables of interest.

Please note that the results generated by each model are not directly comparable, as hyperparameter tuning has not been performed across the models. While tuning is straightforward and can significantly improve model performance, it requires substantial computational resources. Given the scope of this repository, hyperparameter optimisation is left for future exploration.
